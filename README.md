## Project Overview
I did productionize an app, taking it from a no state to a production-ready state. This involves finding and handling error cases, adding accessibility features, allowing for localization

## Why this Project?
As a working Android developer, you often have to create and implement apps where you are responsible for designing and planning the steps you need to take to create a production-ready app.
